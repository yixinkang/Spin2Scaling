# Spin2Scaling
Scaling for Spin2 GPE using discrete exterior calculus


Changed to equal trap (line 116-117)


constexpr double trapFreq_r = 136.22; //126
constexpr double trapFreq_z = 136.22; //166


Need to run COMPUTE_GROUND_STATE =1 to get equal_ground_state_psi_20.00_112.00.dat


Move lambdas_equal.h5 into build for calculating expansion
